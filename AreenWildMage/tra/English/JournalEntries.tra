// First time Party meets Areen
@5100 = ~Areen the wild mage
I met a wild mage named Areen outside the Friendly Arm Inn. Bandits ambushed him and took his research materials and spell book. He seems more scholarly than the other wild magic practitioners that visited Candlekeep.~
// We find Areen's scroll 1
@5101 = ~Areen the wild mage
We found a page from Areen's spellbook. The margins are filled with precise annotations and theoretical calculations, showing his methodical approach to wild magic in every carefully written line.~
// We find Areen's scroll 2
@5102 = ~Areen the wild mage
We recovered another of Areen's lost pages. This one contains detailed observations on surge control techniques, carefully documented with precision.~
// We find Areen's scroll 3
@5103 = ~Areen the wild mage
We found another of Areen's missing pages. More surge control techniques, but these notes show his parents' influence in their rigorous experimental documentation.~
// We find Areen's staff
@5104 = ~Areen the wild mage
We located Areen's staff among the bandit leaders' possessions. The intricate runes suggest careful design for wild magic control - he'll be relieved to have this back.~
// We find Areen's robe
@5105 = ~Areen the wild mage
We discovered Areen's robes among Davaeorn's possessions. The complex enchantments woven into the fabric mark these as tools for serious magical study rather than mere showmanship.~
// We find Areen's recipy book
@5106 = ~Areen the wild mage
We found Areen's stolen recipe book. Though mostly unfinished, its magical crafting theories and annotations about improving existing items show promising research. Alas, the suggested ingredients seem unreachable to us at the moment.~
