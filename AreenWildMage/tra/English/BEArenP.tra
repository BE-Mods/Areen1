@1    = ~I see. Yes, quite. Well, I suppose our arrangement has run its course. Rather unfortunate timing, I shall make the necessary arrangements for solo travel. Again.~
@2    = ~Do try not to spread tales of any wild mages you may encounter behaving like buffoons. We're not all cut from the same cloth, you understand.~
@3    = ~Actually, your knowledge of wild magic might still prove useful. Perhaps I was hasty...~
@4    = ~This isn't personal, Areen. Safe travels.~
@5    = ~Well, well. If it isn't my former traveling companions. I don't suppose you've come to discuss the theoretical applications of controlled wild magic surges?~
@6    = ~I could use your expertise again, Areen.~
@7    = ~Just passing through. Good luck with your surges.~
@8    = ~I see you've come to your senses about proper magical standards.~
@9    = ~Yes Areen, please join me.~
@10   = ~This changes nothing. Farewell.~
